# Challenge One - Horiseon

This project is focused around refining existing HTML and CSS code to increase accessibility and legibilty of code. By consolidating classes, there was a large amount of redundant CSS code that could be removed to improve legibility of code as well as reduce potential future confusion if a new developer comes in and adds additional code for the client.

The consolidation of classes also allowed for some changes to simplify the HTML, which made it easier to identify id links that were not working properly. By consolidating identially-branded classes, we've also established a good chunk of code that contains concise branding requirements set out by the client in case future use is needed.
